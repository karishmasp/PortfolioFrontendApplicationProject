# PortfolioFrontendApplicationProject
This is a front-end Web application called as "PORTFOLIO" which is created with technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. 

This application, which has parts for the home page, about, contact, and portfolio, essentially summarizes my portfolio. 

It also include an audio-based description in the "about" area and my resume may be downloaded from the "portfolio" section. 

There isn't a backend for this application yet.
