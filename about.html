                        <h1>Karishma Palekar</h1>
                        <p>
                            A passionate and driven student eager to embark on an exciting journey of learning and growth. Currently pursuing BE in CSE at New Horizon College of Engineering, Bangalore, I am dedicated to expanding my knowledge and honing my skills in programming.<br>

                            Driven by curiosity and a thirst for knowledge, I thrive on challenges that push me to think critically and innovate. My academic pursuits have not only equipped me with a strong foundation in programming, but they have also instilled in me a deep sense of discipline and the ability to work collaboratively in diverse teams.<br>

                            I believe that continuous learning is the key to personal and professional growth. As I progress through my academic journey, I am excited to explore new opportunities, tackle challenges head-on, and forge meaningful connections with fellow students, mentors, and professionals.<br>

                            Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I invite you to explore my projects and experiences to get to know me better. If you'd like to connect or collaborate, please don't hesitate to reach out. I look forward to connecting with you and sharing in the journey of lifelong learning and discovery.
